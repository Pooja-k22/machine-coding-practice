# React + Vite

You are tasked with creating a "Chips Input" component that enables users to input a series of tags or keywords. These inputs should be displayed as "chips" (small labels) that can be dynamically added and removed.

Key Features Required:

Input Field: A field where users can type text.

Add Chips: When the user presses the "Enter" key, the typed text should be added as a new chip. Empty or whitespace-only inputs should not form chips.

Remove Chips: Users should be able to delete a chip by clicking an "X" button associated with it.

Horizontal Display: The chips need to be displayed in a horizontal list format.

Persistence: The list of chips must remain even when the component re-renders, implying the use of state management within the React component to store and update the chips. 

This problem assesses a developer's understanding of React components, state management (e.g., using useState hook for functional components or this.state for class components), event handling (e.g., onKeyDown for Enter key, onClick for remove button), and basic UI rendering in a dynamic list format.
